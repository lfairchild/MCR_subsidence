    "The subsidence history of the MCR is strongly tied to the degree of lithospheric thinning throughout rift development, and is therefore related to the total amount of offset between either side of the MCR limbs. The magnitude of this offset (the amount of spreading actually attained during rifting) can potentially have strong influences on the paleolatitudes interpretted through paleomagnetic data. Fortunately, much paleomagnetic data, from which estimates for plate velocity and Mesoproterozoic paleogeography derive, are oriented in such a way relative to the rift that should record reliable paleolatitude of Laurentia regardless of spreading (i.e. paleomagnetic poles from Osler Group, North Shore volcanic group, etc. indicate alignment with a geomagnetic field oriented perpendicular to the direction of rifting). However, given the overall \"U\"-shaped geometry of the MCR, this is a fortuitous result of the inferred rifting direction only where MCR rocks are largely accessible for paleomagnetic sampling (north and south Lake Superior). *Discuss new Halls2015 paper and influence of Grenville Orogeny, which probably influenced post-rift subsidence but estimates of its degree of influence varies wildly"

    "Reconciling estimates of thermal subsidence of a modeled, isolated rift system with current seismic observations could elucidate the tectonic setting of the MCR and other potential influences on its post-rift thermal subsidence. MCR thermal subsidence was still under way at the time of the ~1040 Ma Grenville Orogeny, when it is thought MCR normal faults were reactivated as reverse faults, accomodating the [Laurentia-Amazonia]? continental collision. Estimates of overall crustal shortening during this episode vary from 30 km (White1997) to 4000 km (Halls2015). Juxtaposing modeled and observed thermal subsidence in the MCR could provide much-needed clarification to the intensity of this crustal shortening, as such a comparison may reveal just to what degree the thermal subsidence of the MCR was interrupted by the onset of a collisional event. Additionally, if the nature of MCR thermal subsidence is resolvable and not overwhelmed by the influence of the Grenville Orogeny, this could provide insight into the magmatic origin of the MCR. For instance, because the buoyant upwelling of a mantle plume, thermal subsidence would have been both delayed and mitigated by presumed syn-rift lithospheric upwarping. If mantle temperatures were normal (no plume), and MCR volcanism was largely a feature of passive spreading and decompression melting, White1997 showed that post-rift subsidence in the MCR by 1050 Ma would have reached depths far greater (~18 km) than those actually observed (4-8 km). This point is therefore used as an argument for a mantle plume origin of the MCR, in contrast to the argument that MCR was largely a result of far-field stresses due to the rifting of Amazonia from Laurentia and ceased once an oceanic basin formed between the two continents."
