    "The MCR has long been considered a rift system whose volcanism was greatly amplified by a mantle plume or heat anomaly. While it is hard to attribute the LIP-like character of the MCR to anything other than a mantle plume, a major subject of disagreement is the initial cause of rifting and lithospheric thinning. Recent studies (Stein2014, Levandowski2015) put forth the argument that rifting began in response to far-field stresses associated with the rifting of Amazonia from Laurentia, and that the MCR's dramatic volcanic volume was a result of a chance encounter between a devloping subrift system and a mantle plume. However, a more parsimonious interpretation might suggest the dual LIP and rift-like nature of the MCR to be interrelated. "
