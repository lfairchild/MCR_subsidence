  N2 - Rifts are segmented linear depressions that are filled with sedimentary
  and igneous rocks; they form by extension and often evolve into plate
  boundaries. Flood basalts, a class of large igneous provinces (LIPs), are
  broad regions of extensive volcanism formed by sublithospheric processes.
  Typical rifts are not filled with flood basalts, and typical flood basalts
  are not associated with significant crustal extension and faulting. North
  America's Midcontinent Rift (MCR) is an unusual combination, because its
  3000-km length formed during a continental breakup event 1.1 Ga, but it
  contains an enormous volume of igneous rocks that are mostly flood basalt. We
  show that MCR volcanic rocks are significantly thicker than other flood
  basalts, due to their deposition in a narrow rift rather than across a broad
  region, giving the MCR a rift's geometry but a LIP's magma volume. Structural
  modeling of seismic-reflection data shows that LIP volcanics were deposited
  during two phases—an initial rift phase where flood basalts filled a
  fault-controlled extending basin and a postrift phase where LIP volcanics and
  sediments were deposited in a thermally subsiding sag basin without
  associated faulting. The crust thinned during the initial rifting phase and
  then rethickened during the postrift phase and later compression, yielding
  the present thicker crust observed seismologically. The restriction of
  extension to a single normal fault in each rift segment, steeply
  inward-dipping rift shoulders with sharp hinges, and persistence of volcanism
  after rifting ended gave rise to a deep flood basalt–filled rift geometry
  not observed in other presently active or ancient rifts. The unusual
  coincidence of a rift and LIP arose when a new rift associated with
  continental breakup interacted with a mantle plume or overrode anomalously
  hot or fertile upper mantle.}
